			<h1 class="beta  color-000">Design System "Nimbus" Creation for Capterra</h1>
			<h2 class="delta  color-300">I designed, developed, and evangelized a brand new design system</h2>
			<p class="epsilon  color-300  epsilon-padding-top">Starting in November 2018 my primary goal and responsibility was to define and design a fully fledged design system for our buyer-facing product. I began the project by throwing myself into research - I found Brad Frost's Atomic Design, read through Invision's Design System Handbook, and even attended Clarity, a conference dedicated to system-based design. Frustratingly, I now know that nothing could prepare me for this project better than experience.</p>
			<p class="epsilon  color-300  epsilon-padding-top">I gathered expectations from stakeholders. Leadership wanted a more consistent and professional UI on the site, but didn't want to expend resources on a system. Product wanted deliverables faster when they asked for design and frontend work. Tech wanted to implement a new stack using Elastic Search, React, Lambchop, and more. Design wanted to stop spending hours creating spec docs of the same components over and over again. The more people I asked, the more stakeholders I found.</p>
			<p class="epsilon  color-300  epsilon-padding-top">In the end, I was given one developer and one other designer as a resource to make this system into a reality. We began the process of converting the design that already existed on the live site into the Atomic Design framework. We figured that while this wouldn't solve the problem of introducing beautiful UI to the site, it would help us implement a redesign faster in the future. It also allowed the developers some breathing room to build out the new tech stack.</p>
			<p class="epsilon  color-300  epsilon-padding-top">This proved to be an invaluable learning opportunity. Not only did it anger leadership (oops) because they didn't see any visible changes on the site, but Atomic Design ended up slowing us down more than anything else. We found ourselves having endless conversations about component classification rather than spending our limited time improving upon them, or building new ones. We also found that the majority of components larger than atoms were too specific to be easily used across templates.</p>
			<p class="epsilon  color-300  epsilon-padding-top">It became my job to re-right the ship. We started from ground zero and began designing a system in Figma that we would love to have, rather than what it already was. We came up with a list of 40 components with varrying degrees of complexity and decided to tackle them one at a time instead of worrying about classification. We focused on defining air-tight design tokens that carried through each and every component without exceptions. We started A/B testing new components against existing designs to validate assumptions.</p>
			<p class="epsilon  color-300  epsilon-padding-top">As the Figma file grew, it became easier and easier to sell the need for resources to leadership. We could point to the beautiful, effective, and tested components and quickly show how much more efficient our design and frontend development processes could be if we devote the time to getting it right. Amazingly we were able to get leadership on board. In February 2020 we released "Phase One" of Nimbus (Capterra's Design System).</p>
			<p class="epsilon  color-300  epsilon-padding-top">Component-based design and systems thinking has challenged me to see UI design in a new light. Instead of approaching each ticket in a silo, I am forced to remember the greater environment in which our designs live. When building a component, I <span class="italic">have</span> to think through every possible use-case or it simply won't be an effective component. I have to be intentional with the typography and color choices I make because their context means more when there are only 5 colors to choose from.</p>
			<p class="epsilon  color-300  epsilon-padding-top">On this page are a few samples from the Nimbus design system. Each component within Nimbus is defined in as much or more detail as shown here. Below is a list of all the components we chose to build:</p>
