They accomplish this by polling thousands of respondents daily to create rich analyses customized to each client's specific business objective.</div>
	</div>
	<div class="stack">
		<div class="epsilon  weight-normal  delta-margin-top">Historically, fielding surveys at Morning Consult has been an unstandardized, highly manual, and time consuming process that spread across multiple divisions.

		<div class="epsilon  weight-normal  delta-margin-top">These goals translated into key success metrics for our team and were important to understanding and cutting scope.

		<div class="epsilon  zeta-padding-top  color-medium-gray">The problem statement framework is especially helpful when tackling a product with nebulous scope.

However, we were less clear on exactly which features would need to be included in the MVP in order for the product to satisfy user problems.</div>
		<div class="epsilon  zeta-padding-top  color-medium-gray">From user research, we generated 10 problem statements that each received dedicated, cross-functional solution brainstorming. I was able to draw a connecting line between user research and the solutions we were building. This made getting resourcing and leadership approval much easier, and discouraged teammates from proposing solutions based on assumptions.</div>
		<div class="epsilon  zeta-padding-top  color-medium-gray">In follow-up feedback sessions, I asked users to review our team's proposed solutions and to rank them in order of highest to lowest impact.

It included the full gamut of solutions my team had brainstormed. It was incredibly useful in building consensus and getting early feedback before scoping and technical estimation began.</div>
		<div class="epsilon  zeta-padding-top  color-medium-gray">The flow began exclusively as text boxes, but as I presented the flow to leadership teams, I realized that the text was not conveying the full possibilities of the product, and was often creating more confusion than clarification.

		<div class="epsilon  zeta-padding-top  color-medium-gray">Because this product literally didn't exist yet, it was important that the sliver of features we chose for MVP covered each step of the full end-to-end user experience. This allowed us to onboard beta users at the end of the 6 month mark and begin validating the flow.
