		<div class="beta  weight-bold  delta-margin-top">Stakeholder research</div>
		<div class="gamma  weight-normal  delta-margin-top">After documenting user problems, I partnered with my product manager to gather stakeholder input to better understand solution design scope. I interviewed developers, business leaders, and product leaders to create a short, medium, and long term vision for the product.</div>
	</div>
	<div class="stack">
		<div class="epsilon  weight-normal  delta-margin-top">In these interviews I ran through a summary of user feedback and the hypotheses we'd developed for solving these problems. I focused on the most impactful user problem: users wanted to work together within the visualization tool, but were unable to do so easily, or securely. The stakeholder research revealed a number of technical blockers to creating a sharing solution:</div>
	</div>
	<div class="stack-medium  beta-margin-top  beta-margin-bottom">
		<div class="grid-3">
			<div class="card  myshadow  text-center">
				<div class="circle-blue  epsilon  weight-bold  margin-auto">1</div>
				<span class="epsilon  epsilon-padding-top  weight-bold">Developing improvements to the account system was painful</span>
				<span class="epsilon  epsilon-padding-top">The authentication model was built using outdated technology that made introducing new features miserable for the development teams</span>
			</div>
			<div class="card  myshadow  text-center">
				<div class="circle-blue  epsilon  weight-bold  margin-auto">2</div>
				<span class="epsilon  epsilon-padding-top  weight-bold">The platform's accounts and content were not connected to client teams</span>
				<span class="epsilon  epsilon-padding-top">Many accounts existed for each client contract, but the data model had no knowledge that these accounts were connected to one another</span>
			</div>
			<div class="card  myshadow  text-center">
				<div class="circle-blue  epsilon  weight-bold  margin-auto">3</div>
				<span class="epsilon  epsilon-padding-top  weight-bold">Users created data visualizations for more than one client team</span>
				<span class="epsilon  epsilon-padding-top">Internal users were servicing 8-10 client accounts at any given time, and it would be a legal issue to share content with the wrong client</span>
			</div>
		</div>
	</div>
	<div class="stack">
		<div class="epsilon  weight-normal  delta-margin-top">I found that users were commonly sharing login information in order to have access to the same content. One of the product team's driving business goals is to increase the number of active users. Uncovering this sharing-work-around was a big motivator to rework the data model to enable cross-team collaboration, and to, hopefully, encourage client teams to onboard new users.</div>
		<div class="epsilon  weight-normal  delta-margin-top">This stakeholder research illuminated just how many systems would need to be updated to enable a sharing feature. The work was broken up between two scrum teams: one team would focus on rebuilding the authentication model to create a systematized approach to the content-user-team relationship, and one team would focus on building the content sharing MVP.</div>
		<div class="epsilon  weight-normal  delta-margin-top">Because this work spanned two scrum teams, the order in which designs were needed was a high priority for me and my product manager. It was our goal to reduce (as much as possible) the cross-team blockers and to keep the release schedule iterative and consistent.</div>

		<div class="gamma  weight-normal  delta-margin-top">The sharing MVP required a technical migration which presented an opportunity to overhaul the accounts management UI. After creating an end-to-end user flow from account creation, to visualization sharing, I created wireframes that updated the old UI to the new design system components.</div>
	</div>
	<div class="stack  delta-margin-top">
		<div class="epsilon  weight-normal  delta-margin-top">Technical migrations take time and focus to be done effectively. In previous migrations, it has meant a near halt to feature releases. In this project, we were keen to pair the backend improvements with frontend improvements to maintain continuous delivery of user value. This meant a complete redesign of the accounts management UI, both to the information architecture, and to the user interactions.</div>

		<div class="epsilon  weight-normal  delta-margin-top">I learned from prior user research that many basic functions within the accounts management system caused user confusion and frustration. Something as simple as changing an account's email had resulted in dozens of IT support tickets in the year prior. As I redesigned these pages, I prioritized streamlining these common jobs-to-be-done to reduce friction and add clarity.</div>
