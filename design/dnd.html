				<div class="gamma  weight-bold">The Problem</div>
				<div class="delta  epsilon-padding-top">Dungeons & Dragons has used an outdated, inaccessible, and mandatory onboarding experience for the nearly 50 years it’s existed. New players have a difficult time discovering the game because there is no user friendly, fun, gamified way to get started. </div>
				<div class="epsilon  epsilon-padding-top  color-medium-gray">Dungeons & Dragons is one of my favorite hobbies. It lets players escape to worlds beyond their wildest imagination, connect with friends through problem solving and role playing, and flex their creative muscles in new and unique ways. However, a tabletop, pen-and-paper role-playing game created in the ‘70s comes with some major UX flaws.</div>
				<div class="epsilon  epsilon-padding-top  color-medium-gray">The most glaring of these issues is, in my opinion, the character creation process. In order to play D&D, each player needs to first create a fantasy character loaded with stats, weapons, physical characteristics, personality traits, inventory, and more. All of this detailed information has traditionally been captured on a complicated, difficult to read “Character Sheet” in an hours long meeting led by the most experienced player in the room who reads out of a book to guide their fellow players. The character creation process is esoteric and uninviting to inexperienced players.</div>
				<div class="epsilon  epsilon-padding-top  color-medium-gray">I set out to not only create a product that could speed up this experience, but also turn character creation into a game in its own right. What if creating a character was not a prerequisite to playing Dungeons & Dragons, but a game that people would want to play no matter the occasion?</div>

				<div class="gamma  weight-bold">User Interviews</div>
				<div class="delta  epsilon-padding-top">I interviewed 10 people to kick off this project. Some had only ever played D&D once, others for 40+ years, but all of the interviewees agreed that the character creation process was flawed. Players wanted an easier to skim, more interactive creation process.</div>
				<div class="epsilon  epsilon-padding-top  color-medium-gray">Before ideating specific solutions to the problem, I interviewed 10 people from all walks of life who had played D&D before for 60 minutes. My interviewees ranged from young adults who had only played once at the urging of a friend, to adults who had been playing and leading others for over 40 years. This disparity in player experience was important to capture as brand new players had slightly different issues with character creation than experienced players.</div>
				<div class="epsilon  epsilon-padding-top  color-medium-gray">I compiled all the interview results into bite-sized sentiments and sorted them by theme. I found that the largest areas for improvement requested by players are (1) players want to know how the rest of the group is making choices, (2) there is too much content to read through to get the process done quickly, and (3) the mechanics of the game are confusing to new players and it causes character creation to feel opaque.</div>
				<div class="epsilon  epsilon-padding-top  color-medium-gray">One of my biggest concerns was that players would be resistant to a digital solution; because D&D is a foundational tabletop game, some players hold the non-digital experience as sacrosanct. However, I found that a number of players already incorporate digital products into character creation, though none allowed the user to feel like they were playing a game rather than using a tool.</div>

				<div class="gamma  weight-bold">User Personas</div>
				<div class="delta  epsilon-padding-top">Despite player experience, three main personas emerged from my interviews and research: players who want to be lead, players who like to lead, and players who want to strike their own path. Balancing these personas requires a very flexible product.</div>
				<div class="epsilon  epsilon-padding-top  color-medium-gray">Three personas emerged from my interviews. The first is players who like to lead the group in character creation. In D&D terms, these people are called “Dungeon Masters”. Their goals are distinct from players; Dungeon Masters want to successfully get all the players in the room to correctly fill in all their character details and be ready to play the game.</div>
				<div class="epsilon  epsilon-padding-top  color-medium-gray">The other two personas refer to the main two types of players: Researchers and Discoverers. Researchers like to read everything to do with every option they are presented with. They want to make the most informed choice they possibly can. Discoverers prefer to “go with their gut” and describe a preference to the Dungeon Master and follow their recommendation. They want to be guided through the experience and trust an expert to narrow down their choices.</div>

			<div class="grid-2thirds  delta-padding-right  mobile-no-padding">
				<div class="gamma  weight-bold">User Journey</div>
				<div class="delta  epsilon-padding-top">Creating a character has clear, linear steps players must complete in order to accomplish this process. Some of these steps are more exciting than others. Mapping the user journey allowed me to focus on improving the frustrating steps, and mimicking the good ones.</div>
				<div class="epsilon  epsilon-padding-top  color-medium-gray">I identified my main persona (the Discoverer) and plotted her positive and negative emotions over the course of creating a character. I found that the experience has a “whiplashing” effect on players; every new step is daunting and slightly frustrating, but becomes interesting and fun once players get used to the idea. However, just when users are comfortable with a step, it’s time to move on to the next one.</div>
				<div class="epsilon  epsilon-padding-top  color-medium-gray">The main source of negative emotions in the user journey came from the player’s lack of understanding and information going into each step. Because there is so much history and reading associated with each of these steps, players quickly become overwhelmed by the experience and start to lose hope that the character they create truly represents their intentions. Positive emotions came from the excitement of learning something new and seeing a world of possibilities laid before them.</div>

				<div class="gamma  weight-bold">User Flow</div>
				<div class="delta  epsilon-padding-top">In deciding to gamify the character creation experience, I needed to spend a lot of time organizing a user flow that allows players to progress linearly through my product without getting bored, or forced down paths they dislike.</div>
				<div class="epsilon  epsilon-padding-top  color-medium-gray">Character creation needs to happen linearly (i.e. players need to go down a set path and complete all the choices they are presented with in order to be done with their character). This means the product inherently needs to act more like a massive, multi-step form than it does a website with many distinct entry/exit points. However, the order in which these tasks take place is up for debate.</div>
				<div class="epsilon  epsilon-padding-top  color-medium-gray">In my interviews, I found that the default order presented by the official game is not ideal for new players. It asks players to provide the more flavorful information (like name, age, appearance, etc) right at the beginning of the experience before many new players have even begun to figure out how the game works. In reworking the user flow, I focused on putting the most important and impactful choices at the beginning of the experience. This lets players make foundational choices first before adding superfluous details. For example, it’s hard to pick a name for a fantasy character before first knowing that the character is a Dwarf.</div>

				<div class="gamma  weight-bold">The Solution</div>
				<div class="delta  epsilon-padding-top">I have begun wireframing and prototyping a JackBox-inspired mobile app game to help players and Dungeon Masters efficiently and entertainingly complete the character creation process with collaborative and competitive game mechanics.</div>
				<div class="epsilon  epsilon-padding-top  color-medium-gray">In order to solve one of the most common issues that arose from interviews and research, this game will be a mobile app companion game that corresponds to prompts on a monitor. This solution allows individual players to make choices while still getting a holistic view of the decisions their fellow party members are making. This also allows Dungeon Masters to check in on their players and quickly identify anyone who needs extra guidance. Finally, this setup allows for on-screen explanations with easy to understand videos and tutorials for the more confusing aspects of character creation.</div>
				<div class="epsilon  epsilon-padding-top  color-medium-gray">Taking cues from JackBox Games, this character creation app will connect players by sending open ended prompts about their characters to players in the room and awarding points to the best answer. Introducing a semi-competitive element to the app will add moments of excitement when steps get dull.</div>
				<div class="epsilon  epsilon-padding-top  color-medium-gray">Ideation also led a number of ways to spice up the more complicated steps in this process. For example, when choosing a Class, there are over a dozen classes with lengthy descriptions and in-depth statistics. Reading all that content is overwhelming to the player and causes some to spend insane amounts of time getting through it, and others to simply skip reading, and potentially regret their decision later. The product I am designing introduces a personality quiz with funny and thought provoking questions to give users a short list of 3 classes that best suit their play style.</div>
				<div class="epsilon  epsilon-padding-top  color-medium-gray">I am wireframing the main user flow with plans to present a working (though basic) prototype to users to test flow, comprehension, time to completion, hierarchy, and onboarding. I hope to continue iterating on this idea and begin working on higher fidelity aspects of the product in the future.</div>
