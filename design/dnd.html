		<div class="beta  weight-bold  delta-margin-top">The Problem</div>
		<div class="gamma  weight-normal  delta-margin-top">Dungeons & Dragons has used an outdated, inaccessible, and mandatory onboarding experience for the nearly 50 years it’s existed. New players have a difficult time discovering the game because there is no user friendly, fun, gamified way to get started.</div>

				<div class="epsilon-margin-top">
					<div class="circle-orange-sm  vertical-middle  zeta-margin-right  display-inline-block"></div><span class="epsilon  vertical-middle">Dungeons & Dragons is one of my favorite hobbies. It lets players escape to worlds beyond their wildest imagination, connect with friends through problem solving and role playing, and flex their creative muscles in new and unique ways. However, a tabletop, pen-and-paper role-playing game created in the ‘70s comes with some major UX flaws.<br><span class="color-gray  zeta">Users were not finding the right software products for their business needs</span></span>
				</div>
				<div class="epsilon-margin-top">
					<div class="circle-orange-sm  vertical-middle  zeta-margin-right  display-inline-block"></div><span class="epsilon  vertical-middle">The most glaring of these issues is, in my opinion, the character creation process. In order to play D&D, each player needs to first create a fantasy character loaded with stats, weapons, physical characteristics, personality traits, inventory, and more. All of this detailed information has traditionally been captured on a complicated, difficult to read “Character Sheet” in an hours long meeting led by the most experienced player in the room who reads out of a book to guide their fellow players. The character creation process is esoteric and uninviting to inexperienced players.<br><span class="color-gray  zeta">The page's value proposition was unclear, or untrustworthy, on initial load</span></span>
				</div>
				<div class="epsilon-margin-top">
					<div class="circle-orange-sm  vertical-middle  zeta-margin-right  display-inline-block"></div><span class="epsilon  vertical-middle">I set out to not only create a product that could speed up this experience, but also turn character creation into a game in its own right. What if creating a character was not a prerequisite to playing Dungeons & Dragons, but a game that people would want to play no matter the occasion?<br><span class="color-gray  zeta">Of the users who converted, they did not sign up for accounts with the software</span></span>

		<div class="beta  weight-bold  delta-margin-top">User Interviews</div>
		<div class="gamma  weight-normal  delta-margin-top">I interviewed 10 people to kick off this project. Some had only ever played D&D once, others for 40+ years, but all of the interviewees agreed that the character creation process was flawed. Players wanted an easier to skim, more interactive creation process.</div>

	</div>
	<div class="stack">
		<div class="epsilon  epsilon-padding-top">Before ideating specific solutions to the problem, I interviewed 10 people from all walks of life who had played D&D before for 60 minutes. My interviewees ranged from young adults who had only played once at the urging of a friend, to adults who had been playing and leading others for over 40 years. This disparity in player experience was important to capture as brand new players had slightly different issues with character creation than experienced players.</div>

I found that the largest areas for improvement requested by players are (1) players want to know how the rest of the group is making choices, (2) there is too much content to read through to get the process done quickly, and (3) the mechanics of the game are confusing to new players and it causes character creation to feel opaque.</span>

However, I found that a number of players already incorporate digital products into character creation, though none allowed the user to feel like they were playing a game rather than using a tool.</span>

The first is players who like to lead the group in character creation. In D&D terms, these people are called “Dungeon Masters”.

Researchers like to read everything to do with every option they are presented with. They want to make the most informed choice they possibly can. Discoverers prefer to “go with their gut” and describe a preference to the Dungeon Master and follow their recommendation. They want to be guided through the experience and trust an expert to narrow down their choices.</span>

		<div class="beta  weight-bold  delta-margin-top">User Journey</div>
		<div class="gamma  weight-normal  delta-margin-top">Creating a character has clear, linear steps players must complete in order to accomplish this process. Some of these steps are more exciting than others. Mapping the user journey allowed me to focus on improving the frustrating steps, and mimicking the good ones.</div>

	<div class="stack">
		<div class="epsilon  epsilon-padding-top">I identified my main persona (the Discoverer) and plotted her positive and negative emotions over the course of creating a character. I found that the experience has a “whiplashing” effect on players; every new step is daunting and slightly frustrating, but becomes interesting and fun once players get used to the idea. However, just when users are comfortable with a step, it’s time to move on to the next one.</div>
		<div class="epsilon  epsilon-padding-top">The main source of negative emotions in the user journey came from the player’s lack of understanding and information going into each step. Because there is so much history and reading associated with each of these steps, players quickly become overwhelmed by the experience and start to lose hope that the character they create truly represents their intentions. Positive emotions came from the excitement of learning something new and seeing a world of possibilities laid before them.</div>
		<div class="epsilon  epsilon-padding-top">In deciding to gamify the character creation experience, I needed to spend a lot of time organizing a user flow that allows players to progress linearly through my product without getting bored, or forced down paths they dislike.</div>
		<div class="epsilon  epsilon-padding-top">Character creation needs to happen linearly (i.e. players need to go down a set path and complete all the choices they are presented with in order to be done with their character). This means the product inherently needs to act more like a massive, multi-step form than it does a website with many distinct entry/exit points. However, the order in which these tasks take place is up for debate.</div>
		<div class="epsilon  epsilon-padding-top">In my interviews, I found that the default order presented by the official game is not ideal for new players. It asks players to provide the more flavorful information (like name, age, appearance, etc) right at the beginning of the experience before many new players have even begun to figure out how the game works. In reworking the user flow, I focused on putting the most important and impactful choices at the beginning of the experience. This lets players make foundational choices first before adding superfluous details. For example, it’s hard to pick a name for a fantasy character before first knowing that the character is a Dwarf.</div>
