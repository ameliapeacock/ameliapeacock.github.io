				<div class="gamma  weight-bold">The Problem</div>
				<div class="delta  epsilon-padding-top">Any change in conversion rates on the Directory Page results in a direct change in revenue for the business. Because of this, dark patterns, frustrating UX, and outdated UI have been introduced to the Directory template in the name of increasing conversions.</div>
				<div class="epsilon  epsilon-padding-top  color-medium-gray">Capterra is, at its heart, a collection of directories featuring software product information and reviews. As a PPC business, Capterra makes the majority of its money from user conversions on those directory pages. Because of this, the Directory Page template has long resisted changes to its UX/UI; conversions have been relatively steady. If it’s not broken, why fix it?</div>
				<div class="epsilon  epsilon-padding-top  color-medium-gray">However, changes to Google’s algorithm have eaten into the quality traffic coming through the site and Capterra has begun to experience a steady decline in conversions. Leadership charged the product team with getting our conversion rates on the Directory Page back to, or above, where they were before the algorithm changes, even if it means drastic changes to functionality, look, and feel.</div>
				<div class="epsilon  epsilon-padding-top  color-medium-gray">The other major challenge with this template is that while conversions, up until recently, have been strong, return visitation and brand recognition have remained low. Users consistently saw Capterra as a “pass through” site, and not a place to find valuable software buying resources and guidance. One of the major success metrics for this project is identifying exactly why users are not returning to this page, and then implementing a design that will increase return visitation.</div>

				<div class="gamma  weight-bold">Research Findings</div>
				<div class="delta  epsilon-padding-top">Through A/B testing, unmoderated usability testing, moderated interviews, and heatmapping, my team and I identified the major areas that were failing in the old design: the filter, the product information, and the Capterra-provided written content.</div>
				<div class="epsilon  epsilon-padding-top  color-medium-gray">Through user interviews and unmoderated usability testing, we found that users consistently wanted to engage with the filter right away. This falls in line with the best practices we know from ecommerce sites as well. However, the Capterra filter was not prioritizing the data fields users wanted to see (pricing and features). The filter also required users to hit a “submit” button that reloads the page. This outdated functionality caused many users to bounce.</div>
				<div class="epsilon  epsilon-padding-top  color-medium-gray">The cards that featured products also didn’t prioritize the information users wanted to see. In fact, users were consistently frustrated that the cards only displayed a five star review rating and a long description written by the product vendor (these descriptions often used “marketing speak”). We found that users wanted much more information to be immediately visible on the cards, so that they wouldn’t need to open all the products’ websites in new tabs and compare across web pages.</div>
				<div class="epsilon  epsilon-padding-top  color-medium-gray">Lastly we found that many users were landing on Capterra from Google using a keyword that didn’t exactly match what the user really wanted to see. For example, they would search for “Recruitment Software” and land on Capterra’s “Human Resources Software” directory. Users needed to know both how to get to the appropriate directory, and also what the description for each directory is, so they could know they are in the wrong place to begin with.</div>

				<div class="gamma  weight-bold">Prototyping & User Testing</div>
				<div class="delta  epsilon-padding-top">Because conversions are likely to suffer due to the improved UX, it was imperative to have user interviews backing up our design decisions. I tested and iterated many layout variations to find a format that best allows the user to quickly find what they’re looking for.</div>
				<div class="epsilon  epsilon-padding-top  color-medium-gray">Our research proved that some of the dark patterns Capterra had relied on for the past 20 years were harming user trust. For example, only putting basic information on the product card forces users to convert to learn more about each product. There is a risk, then, that actually giving users the necessary information upfront will discourage them from converting to learn more.</div>
				<div class="epsilon  epsilon-padding-top  color-medium-gray">Because of this, it became doubly as important to validate any UX improvements that might harm conversions with user testing. I tested five different product card layouts to find a UI that best supported user engagement (i.e. included many opportunities to convert), while still giving the user all the data points they need to make a buying decision.</div>
				<div class="epsilon  epsilon-padding-top  color-medium-gray">I found that a more traditional two column table was easier for users to read than when the data was centered in one row. I also found that stacking multiple CTAs one on top of the other made it more difficult for users to quickly find the CTAs in the middle of the stack than when they were spread throughout the card. I found that plain old text is easier to find and easier to understand than an icon is to encourage show/hide functionality.</div>
				<div class="epsilon  epsilon-padding-top  color-medium-gray">User testing was completed on all the major pain points that arose from our research. For example, we found that providing links to “related directories” was incredibly successful in reorienting users to appropriate directories. We also found that including expert written content on the general state of each directory (i.e. Average Pricing for Human Resources Software) helped users start to contextualize the product information.</div>

				<div class="gamma  weight-bold">The Solution</div>
				<div class="delta  epsilon-padding-top">The Directory Page will become a tool that gives users more information at a glance than they could discover anywhere else. This helpful, unbiased approach will encourage users to spend more time on Capterra and return to the site throughout their buying process.</div>
				<div class="epsilon  epsilon-padding-top  color-medium-gray">The sheer number of planned improvements to this page has been a daunting challenge for my team. To better align with Scrum, we broke the project down into smaller pieces starting with a technical rearchitecture to improve page speed and performance.</div>
				<div class="epsilon  epsilon-padding-top  color-medium-gray">Rearchitecting the Directory Page in ElasticSearch allows us to build a filter that meets user expectations. The filter will now automatically sort the products on the page, and show exactly which filters have been applied. As a future improvement to encourage return visitation, users will gain the ability to save and share filters.</div>
				<div class="epsilon  epsilon-padding-top  color-medium-gray">The product cards will now feature the data points users most want to see: a short, simple description of the product, the features the product does and does not have, the price, the five star rating, and screenshots of the product. The product card is now fully responsive and the mobile experience no longer leaves out data that’s visible on desktop.</div>
				<div class="epsilon  epsilon-padding-top  color-medium-gray">Because I reoriented the filter to appear horizontally above the product cards, there is now additional space in the sidebar of the Directory Page. We found in our user testing that the sidebar was easily discoverable, so I used it as an opportunity to include more expert content from Capterra’s writers. The sidebar will now feature wayfinding links, and directory-level data that helps put products in context.</div>
				<div class="epsilon  epsilon-padding-top  color-medium-gray">This massive project is slated for development in Q2 of 2020.</div>
				<div class="epsilon  epsilon-padding-top  color-medium-gray  weight-bold">Outcomes:</div>
				<div class="epsilon  zeta-padding-top  color-medium-gray">Page speed (first contentful paint) decreased by 35%. 100% of users discovered the new pricing information (80% of users say they want pricing info on the product cards). 90% of users used the filter, as compared with only 20% on the live site.</div>
