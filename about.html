		<p><br/><br/>On the way to the grocery store, I walk through a park. It's a lovely little park with fountains, dogs and flowers, and by the time I get to the grocery store the charm of the walk usually makes my shopping happy and painless (except when they are out of eggs--I mean seriously, what grocery store runs out of eggs?).</p><br/><br/>
		<p>I believe good design is like my park. Good design makes any menial task pleasant and rewarding. Good design is what drives me to research, problem solve, and create.</p><br/><br/>
		<p>I am always looking for new design challenges and opportunities. I am currently seeking full or part-time work in UX design or research. Reach out directly if you'd like to work with me or learn more about my passion for analytics, visuals, and strategy!</p>

		<p>It has always been hard to answer the "where are you from" question. Short story: I guess Tuscaloosa, Alabama? Long story: I was born in New Orleans, moved to North Carolina when I was 1, moved to San Francisco when I was 3, then moved to Austin TX when I was 5. Along the way, my mom and I picked up a Dad and a couple of extra siblings, camped out in Moscow for a year, and finally relocated to Tuscaloosa, Alabama for my high school years.</p><br/><br/>

		<p>After that I moved to Charlottesville, Virginia for 3 years to attend the University of Virginia. I graduated with a double major in Media Studies and Women, Gender, Sexuality Studies in May of 2016. I threw myself into tour guiding with the University Guide Service, event management with the University Programs Council, and moderating for Sustained Dialogue. I loved my time at UVa and will miss those free Hoos basketball tickets until the day I die.</p><br/><br/>

		<p>The summer of '16 I moved to Washington D.C. (as many a UVa grad is want to do) and started working for Clutch, a B2B start-up here in the city. As a Content Developer and Marketer my primary role is crafting and analysing surveys, writing up articles and blog posts, and pitching and publishing our content. I have also taken on a large role in the company's web design and graphic design process through wireframing and data visualization on our site.</p><br/><br/>
